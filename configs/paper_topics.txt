 1. New applications of multimodal language models (MLLM).
    - Relevant: papers take advantage of multimodal language models.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider multimodal language models.
 2. Papers improves rendering quality with neural networks, like DLSS.
    - Relevant: works on super-resolution, interpolation, extrapolation, denoising and other post-processing tasks in real-time rendering.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider neural networks or not focus on real-time rendering.
 3. Papers improves microscopy image or video quality with neural networks.
    - Relevant: works on super-resolution, frame interpolation, denoising and other image processing tasks for microscopy image and videos.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider microscopy images and videos or focus on segmentation and other recognition tasks.
 4. Papers improves the performance of vision diffusion models and so on.
    - Relevant: papers that improve diffusion models for better generation results, papers that reduce the computational cost of a diffusion model in terms of inference and training, and papers study the image quality generated by the diffusion model.
    - Not relevant: papers about language diffusions, papers about 3D modeling, papers not about diffusion models.
