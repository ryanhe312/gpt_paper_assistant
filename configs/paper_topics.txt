 1. Shows new applications of vision language models (VLMs).
    - Relevant: papers take advantage of vision language models.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider vision language models.
 2. Works on video segmentation that rely on unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods.
    - Relevant: Methods with applications to video object segmentation and video semantic segmentation showing experiments on current and new benchmarks.
    - Not relevant: Application of existing methods to  specialized domains such as medicine, satellites or agriculture with only a slight tweak to the method.
 3. Works on transfer learning between modalities such as audio to video, optical flow to video, language to video and image to video; these papers should consider how to use domain-agnostic data to improve performance on videos.
    - Relevant: Methods that focus on maintaining spatial detail in representations, especially for dense prediction tasks.
    - Not relevant: Image classification, video action recognition and other tasks that do not require pixel-wise understanding.
 4. Shows a significant advance in the performance of text to image, text to video, image to video diffusion models  and so on.
    - Relevant: papers that improve diffusion models for better generation results, papers that reduce the computational cost of a diffusion model in terms of inference and training, and papers study the image quality generated by the diffusion model.
    - Not relevant: papers about language diffusions, papers about 3D modeling.
 5. Marks significant advancements in 3D generation using generative models, including applications in converting images to 3D models and generating 3D models from textual descriptions.
    - Relevant: Papers that enhance the capabilities of generative models for more accurate or detailed 3D creation, studies focusing on reducing the computational demands of these models during both training and inference, and research analyzing the fidelity and quality of 3D models produced by these generative techniques.
    - Not relevant: Research focusing solely on 2D image generation or unrelated aspects of 3D modeling not involving generative models
 6. Shows recent progress on 3D reconstruction and generation with Gaussian Splatting, NeRF, and mesh generation.
    - Relevant: papers that perform 3D reconstruction or generation from multi-view images which can be sparse or pose-free, papers that estimate camera poses and do 3D reconstruction simultaneously.
    - Not relevant: papers that incrementally improve NeRF performance on NeRF synthetic and LIFF datasets.
